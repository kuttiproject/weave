# Kutti Weave

This repository contains a fork of Weave Net, the first product developed by Weaveworks, currently community-maintained at [github.com/rajch/weave](https://github.com/rajch/weave). This fork is intended to be a lightweight CNI add-on for Kubernetes, meant for small clusters and non-production use. Unlike the full Weave Net, it is not intended for use with Docker.
